        <h2>Cybersecurity Tips</h2>
        <p>
            Some key points on how and what not to post on social media for better cybersecurity, with examples from Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook:
            <ul>
<li><strong>Social Engineering Attacks</strong>: Cybercriminals can use information and photos easily found on social media profiles to commit identity theft, create fake accounts, and launch social engineering attacks.</li>
<li>Posting personal details like your child's name, your birthday, or where you went to school can give hackers clues to common password reset questions. </li>
<li>Sharing your location, travel plans, or other real-time updates can make you a target for physical crimes like burglary. </li> 
<li><strong>Malware Distribution</strong>: Social media is an effective way for hackers to distribute malware, as malicious links and downloads can come from a trusted source like a friend or coworker.</li> 
<li>Examples include fake coupons, giveaways, or other clickbait on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat that lead to malicious websites.</li> 
<li><strong>Impersonation Attacks</strong>: Cybercriminals can easily create fake social media accounts that impersonate your business, brand, or employees to trick customers.</li> 
<li>This can happen on any platform, but is common on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn where professional profiles are expected.</li> 
<li><strong>Oversharing</strong>: Frequently posting personal information, photos, and updates on social media provides a wealth of data that hackers can leverage for more targeted attacks.</li> 
            </ul>

This is a particular risk on platforms like Instagram where users often share real-time updates, locations, and tagged friends. 

The key takeaways are to be very cautious about what personal and professional information you share on social media, as it can easily be exploited by cybercriminals. Avoid oversharing details, be wary of suspicious links and downloads, and monitor your accounts for any impersonation attempts
